ar_framework
============

A framework to make it easier to build AR applications.

1. Adding a render application, which clubs OpenCV and OpenGL. Currently, it just reads a cv::Mat from the camera and renders it as openGL texture. The next step would be to perform object tracking with opencv, and finally add the graphic action when the object is detected.
